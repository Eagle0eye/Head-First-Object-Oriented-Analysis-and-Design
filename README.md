### Introduction: 
### Phase 1: Understanding Requirements
- **Understanding what the customer needs very well.**
- **Ask the Customer about details if it's exist.**
- **How to write Use Cases:**
    - **Clear Value:**<br> Every use case must have a clear value to the system. If the use case doesn't help customers achieve their goals, then the use case isn't of much use.
    - **Start and Stop:**<br> Every use case must have a definite starting and stopping point. Something must begin the process, and then there must be a condition that indicates that the process is complete
    - **External Initionators:**<br> Every use case is started off by an external initiator, outside of the system. Sometimes that initiator is a person, but it could be anything outside of the system.
